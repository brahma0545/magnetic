          <h2> Our Objective</h2>

              We train you to complete the project on your own, guiding you in each and every stage. We assume that you have never done any project till now and also that you dont have any prior coding experience, and so we teach everything from basics.
              The projects that are listed are on cutting-edge technologies which has real time applications that makes your project outstanding. These projects will make your resume more appealing and help you in campus placements as well.
              </table>
              You will be provided with the best guidance from mentors with industrial experience, who have completed their post graduation from  prestigious universities (IISc,IIT,NIT,IIIT).

              We make sure that you grasp every detail of the project right from the abstract to its design followed by implementation and finally documentation. We break the project into several smaller assignments and provide you with the solutions along with the explanation.
              By the end of the project you will be confident enough on the knowledge and the skills that you have obtained, which will make your way to the software industry a cake walk.

            <p>The aim of this project is to build a prototype of a large-scale search engine which works on millions of wikipedia pages(which are in xml format of more than 44GB) and retrieves the top-10 relevant wikipedia documents that matches the input query.
                This search engine takes wikipedia Corpus in XML format which is available at wikipedia.org as input. Then it indices millions of wikipedia pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. The final size of the index will be around 7-10 GB. Then given a query, it retrieves relevant ranked documents and their titles using this index.</p>


            <h2>Domains</h2>

            <p>Information Retrieval, Search engines</p>

            <h2>Technologies Needed</h2>

            <p> Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tomcat</p>
